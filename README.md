# JAOGLL

JAOGLL - just another OpenGL library (_working title, you know, naming is hard_) - is my personal small OpenGL library and game engine. It is still in heavy development and uses SDL2 as its window and input manager.

I would not advise anybody to use it at this stage, as it is still pretty unfinished, unpolished and not well documented.

But if you want, here are the instructions:

## Dependencies

You need to have SDL2, OpenGL, GLEW and C++11 installed.

## Installation

```
    make
    sudo make install
```

## Usage

Compile your program with `-lSDL2 -lGL -lGLEW -ljaogll`.
Documentation is in the works (a bit...maybe).
